# ðŸ›¡ Future Tank Lab

**Future Tank Lab** is an interactive Streamlit application that demonstrates future armored vehicle concepts.  
It visualizes trade-offs across survivability, protection, mobility, weapons, sensors, crew, and speculative futurism.  
The app is educational â€” all models are simplified abstractions, not tied to real-world or classified performance.
